            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">3. How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>
            <p>
              We will only use your personal data when the law allows us to. Most commonly, we will use your personal data in the following circumstances:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">
              <li>Where we need to perform the contract we are about to enter into or have entered into with you.</li>
              <li>Where it is necessary for our legitimate interests (or those of a third party) and your interests and fundamental rights do not override those interests.</li>
              <li>Where we need to comply with a legal obligation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-4">
              Generally, we do not rely on consent as a legal basis for processing your personal data although we will get your consent before sending third party direct marketing communications to you via email or text message. You have the right to withdraw consent to marketing at any time by contacting us.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal data from being accidentally lost, used or accessed in an unauthorized way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to a duty of confidentiality.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-4">
              We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected personal data breach and will notify you and any applicable regulator of a breach where we are legally required to do so.
            </p>

            
            <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">5. Your Legal Rights</h2>
            <p>
              Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection laws in relation to your personal data, including the right to:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mt-4">

            <p className="mt-4">
              You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to exercise any of the other rights).
